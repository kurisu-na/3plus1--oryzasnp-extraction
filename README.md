# 3+1 Research: OryzaSNP Data Extraction (Python)

This is a custom Python script used to convert copied text data from the website oryzasnp.org into a table of records containing the paddy's phenotype data. The data was obtained by manually perusing the database and copy-pasting the shown values.

This script was made in part of my 3+1 Research project, to make a classifier using Indonesian rice phenotype data.

This script assumes all acquired data are in the form of a loooooooooooong vertical list, and then stores the end product in CSV format so I can view it as a neat table.

The frontend script is runscriptrun.py. Run that one, please.
The backend script is convert.py.
